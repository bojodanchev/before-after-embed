# Demo follow-up workflow

Use this to re-engage people who interacted with the live demo but didn’t book a call or request access yet.

## 1. Export contacts or leads
- Pull interested practices from the sources you already have: outreach spreadsheet, CRM, or email replies.
- Cross-reference with Vercel Web Analytics "Hostnames" or tracked UTM parameters to confirm which campaigns drove the demo visits.
- Add a column for "Last demo touch" so you can personalize the email.

## 2. Send a short check-in
Use the template below in Gmail/Outlook or paste into your DM sequence. Adjust the bracketed sections to match what they saw.

Subject: Quick question about the before/after demo

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you tried the Before/After visualizer for {{service}} but didn’t finish the flow.
Would you mind sharing what held you back?

Examples we hear:
– Need more real case studies
– Not sure how it embeds into the current site flow
– Pricing or ROI still unclear

If any of those are true (or something else), just hit reply. I can send a tailored example or set up a quick 15‑minute Google Meet if you’d like to talk it through.

Thanks,
{{your_name}}

## 3. Log responses
- Track replies in the same spreadsheet/CRM so the objections become a backlog for copy or product fixes.
- If someone requests a call, point them to the "Book a 15-minute discovery call" button on the site or send the Google Meet link directly.

## 4. Close the loop
Summarize new objections weekly and update the landing page FAQ, pricing notes, or demo script accordingly.
